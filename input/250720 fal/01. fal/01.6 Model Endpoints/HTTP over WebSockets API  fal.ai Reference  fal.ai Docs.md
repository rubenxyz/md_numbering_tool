For applications that require real-time interaction or handle streaming, fal offers a WebSocket-based integration. This allows you to establish a persistent connection and stream data back and forth between your client and the fal API using the same format as the HTTP endpoints.

### WebSocket Endpoint

To utilize the WebSocket functionality, use the `wss` protocol with the the `ws.fal.run` domain:

```
wss://ws.fal.run/{model_id}
```

### Communication Protocol

Once connected, the communication follows a specific protocol with JSON messages for control flow and raw data for the actual response stream:

1.  **Payload Message:** Send a JSON message containing the payload for your application. This is equivalent to the request body you would send to the HTTP endpoint.
    
2.  **Start Metadata:** Receive a JSON message containing the HTTP response headers from your application. This allows you to understand the type and structure of the incoming response stream.
    
3.  **Response Stream:** Receive the actual response data as a sequence of messages. These can be binary chunks for media content or a JSON object for structured data, depending on the `Content-Type` header.
    
4.  **End Metadata:** Receive a final JSON message indicating the end of the response stream. This signals that the request has been fully processed and the next payload will be processed.
    

### Example Interaction

Here’s an example of a typical interaction with the WebSocket API:

**Client Sends (Payload Message):**

```
{"prompt": "generate a 10-second audio clip of a cat purring"}
```

**Server Responds (Start Metadata):**

```
{ "type": "start",
"request_id": "5d76da89-5d75-4887-a715-4302bf435614",
"status": 200,
"headers": { "Content-Type": "text/event-stream; charset=utf-8",
"Transfer-Encoding": "chunked",
// ... }}
```

**Server Sends (Response Stream):**

```
&lt;binary audio data chunk 1&gt;&lt;binary audio data chunk 2&gt;...&lt;binary audio data chunk N&gt;
```

**Server Sends (Completion Message):**

```
{ "type": "end", "request_id": "5d76da89-5d75-4887-a715-4302bf435614", "status": 200, "time_to_first_byte_seconds": 0.577083}
```

This WebSocket integration provides a powerful mechanism for building dynamic and responsive AI applications on the fal platform. By leveraging the streaming capabilities, you can unlock new possibilities for creative and interactive user experiences.

### Example Program

For instance, should you want to make fast prompts to any LLM, you can use `fal-ai/any-llm`.

```
import fal
.appswith fal.apps.ws("fal-ai/any-llm") 
as connection: for i in range(3)
: connection.send( { "model": "google/gemini-flash-1.5", "prompt": f"What is the meaning of life? Respond in {i} words.", } ) 
# they should be in order for i in range(3)
: import json response = json.loads(connection.recv()
) 
print(response)
```

And running this program would output:

```
{'output': '(Silence)\n', 'partial': False, 'error': None}{'output': 'Growth\n', 'partial': False, 'error': None}{'output': 'Personal fulfillment.\n', 'partial': False, 'error': None}
```

### Example Program with Stream

The `fal-ai/any-llm/stream` model is a streaming model that can generate text in real-time. Here’s an example of how you can use it:

```
with fal.apps.ws("fal-ai/any-llm/stream") 
as connection: # NOTE: this app responds in 'text/event-stream' format # For example: # # event: event # data: {"output": "Growth",
"partial": true,
"error": null} for i in range(3)
: connection.send( { "model": "google/gemini-flash-1.5", "prompt": f"What is the meaning of life? Respond in {i+1} words.", } ) 
for i in range(3)
: for bs in connection.stream()
: lines = bs.decode()
.replace("\r\n", "\n")
.split("\n") 
event = {} for line in lines: if not line: continue key,
value = line.split(":", 1) 
event[key] = value.strip() 
print(event["data"]) 
print("----")
```

And running this program would output:

```
{"output": "Perspective", "partial": true, "error": null}{"output": "Perspective.\n", "partial": true, "error": null}{"output": "Perspective.\n", "partial": true, "error": null}{"output": "Perspective.\n", "partial": false, "error": null}----{"output": "Find", "partial": true, "error": null}{"output": "Find meaning.\n", "partial": true, "error": null}{"output": "Find meaning.\n", "partial": true, "error": null}{"output": "Find meaning.\n", "partial": false, "error": null}----{"output": "Be", "partial": true, "error": null}{"output": "Be, love, grow.\n", "partial": true, "error": null}{"output": "Be, love, grow.\n", "partial": true, "error": null}{"output": "Be, love, grow.\n", "partial": false, "error": null}----
```
