While our [Queue system](https://docs.fal.ai/model-endpoints/queue) is the more reliable and recommended way to submit requests, we also support synchronous requests via `https://fal.run`.

Synchronous endpoints are beneficial if when you know the request is quick and you are looking for minimal latency. The drawbacks are:

-   You need to keep the connection open until receiving the result
-   The request cannot be interrupted
-   If the connection is interrupted there is not way to obtain the result
-   You will be charged for the full request whether or not you were able to receive the result

The endpoint format and parameters are similar to the Queue ones:

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`https://fal.run/{model_id}`** | POST | Adds a request to the queue for a top-level path |
| **`https://fal.run/{model_id}/{subpath}`** | POST | Adds a request to the queue for an optional subpath |

Parameters:

-   `model_id`: the model ID consists of a namespace and model name separated by a slash, e.g. `fal-ai/fast-sdxl`. Many models expose only a single top-level endpoint, so you can directly call them by `model_id`.
-   `subpath`: some models expose different capabilities at different sub-paths, e.g. `fal-ai/flux/dev`. The subpath (`/dev` in this case) should be used

### Submit a request

Here is an example of using the curl command to submit a synchronous request:

```
curl -X POST https://fal.run/fal-ai/fast-sdxl \ -H "Authorization: Key $FAL_KEY" \ -d '{"prompt": "a cat"}'
```

The response will come directly from the model:

```
